Please also note 'description' on each file upload
My project is a remix of Kate Bush's 'Running Up That Hill.' Inspired by Lofi and Electronic dance music, the song was developed using Sonic PI. The final product labelled "Assignment Submission Running Up That Hill" was developed through trial and error and multiple versions that incorporated different styles.
