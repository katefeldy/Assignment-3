SONIC PI Git Hub Assignment 3

My project is a remix of Kate Bush's 'Running Up That Hill.' Inspired by Lofi and Electronic dance music, the song was developed using Sonic PI. The final product labelled "Assignment Submission Running Up That Hill" was developed through trial and error and multiple versions that incorporated different styles and can be listened to when run through Sonic PI. The project evolved into a more complex piece than initially planned which allowed me to improve my coding literacy and produce a successful end product.
